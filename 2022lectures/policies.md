# Policies
## Course Format
The primary methods for engaging with the course material are through lectures, discussion sections, homework, and the notes. All are important, and exams will test a mix of the material from these sources.

### Lectures
Live lecture will take place 9:30am - 11:00am on Tuesdays and Thursdays at Pimentel 1. Lectures will be recorded and linked on Ed/Website once lecture is over. It is highly recommended that you watch the lecture the day it is released.


### Discussions
Release Schedule: Discussion worksheets are published at the beginning of the week. The solutions are published after all sections of the day are completed.

We will be assigning sections this semester. The form to sign up will be on Ed and attendance will be taken as part of your grade through a completely objective criteria. You will need to attend at least 13 points to receive full credit for discussion attendance. You are welcome to attend other discussion sections, but your attendance will only be counted for the section you are assigned to. The discussion sections are designed not to cover new material but to consolidate the material covered in lectures and in the notes. All sections are equivalent: they all cover the same material.

Distinguished Alum Lili says, “When I took the course, I tried my best to attend every discussion and ask questions whenever I was confused!”


### Notes

There is no textbook for this class. Instead, there is a set of comprehensive lecture notes posted on the front page for each lecture. Make sure you revisit the notes after every lecture. Each note may be covered in one or more lectures.

Distinguished Alum Megan says, “When I took the course, I studied the notes until I was able to comfortably reproduce all of the proofs.

### Office Hours

Office Hours will be both in-person and online. The OH queue will be hosted at oh.eecs70.org. OHs will be hybrid or remote, please see the calendar for details.

In-Person
See the Calendar tab for OH time and location. You will submit a ticket online at oh.eecs70.org to join the OH queue. In the ticket please specify the room you are currently in. Once it is your turn a course staff member will call your name to help you with your ticket.

Online
At the times listed on the calendar, someone on course staff will be monitoring the online queue. Again, you will submit a ticket online at oh.eecs70.org to join the OH queue with your location specified as online. A course staff member will provide a video call link for you to join when it’s your turn. In-person course staff will prioritize helping in-person tickets on the queue.

Participation
We encourage participation. Participation includes attending lectures live, contributing in discussion, asking and answering questions on Ed, using Party OH, and more. The more you engage with the class, the more fun it is and the better you do.

## Technology

### Ed
We will use Ed as the ‘one-stop shop’ throughout the semester: for a Q&A forum and official announcements. Enrollment in Ed is mandatory. If you have questions about anything related to the course, please post them on Ed rather than emailing the professors or TAs. Please do not post anything resembling a solution to a homework problem before it’s due. See the Ed Etiquette section for more on using Ed. To join the class on Ed, click this.


### Gradescope
All homework and vitamins will be submitted through Gradescope. All homework, vitamin, and exam grades will be returned through Gradescope. If you have not been enrolled in our Gradescope, please fill out this form.


### Email
Please use Ed for all technical questions. If you have a more specific administrative question or any feedback, please send an email to the course administrative account fa22@eecs70.org. Emails sent to this account are only seen by the instructors and head TAs.


## Assignments and Exams
### Homework
There will be weekly required homeworks designed to consolidate your understanding of the course material. We strongly recommend starting these early since there will be no office hours support on weekends.

Release Schedule: Homework for the coming week is released on Sunday. Homework is due on Gradescope the following Saturday at 4:00 pm (grace period until Saturday 6:00pm); the solutions for that homework will be released on Sunday along with the new Homework.

Homework scores will be out of 73% and no extra credit will be granted for getting over 73%.

Your lowest two homework scores before the midterm and the lowest two homework scores after the midterm will be dropped, with a maximum of four total homework drops. These drops should be reserved for emergencies. No additional allowances will be made for late or missed homeworks: please do not contact us about missed homeworks or late submissions.

We may sample homework problems to grade each week.

We recommend that you start the homeworks as early as possible so you get more time to think about the problems and get help if you end up getting stuck. Additionally, Head TA Richard Hu also recommends that you carefully review the homework solutions after they are released and understand them to the point of being able to replicate them without needing to reference them. Having a comprehensive understanding of topics on the homework will go a long way in giving you the intuition you need to succeed!


### Vitamins

Release Schedule: The vitamin for the current week is released on Gradescope on Sunday. The vitamin is due on Gradescope the following Saturday at 4:00 pm (grace period until Saturday 6:00 pm, no question asked); the solutions for that vitamin will be released on Sunday.

There will be weekly required vitamins designed to consolidate your understanding of the course material. If you read the notes in advance and attend the lectures, they should be quick to complete. As a result, there will be no Ed support for vitamins.

Your lowest two vitamin scores before the midterm and the lowest two vitamin scores after the midterm will be dropped, with a maximum of four total vitamin drops. These drops should be reserved for emergencies. No additional allowances will be made for late or missed vitamins: please do not contact us about missed vitamins or late submissions.

Vitamin Submission
Vitamins are due at the same time as homework. You need to submit your answers directly on Gradescope. If you have questions on how to do this, please make a private post on Ed.

### Exams

We will have one midterm and a final and both will be conducted in-person. If you are unable to attend the exam in-person, please check Ed for details on how to proceed.

Unfortunately, due to large enrollment, we are unable to accommodate final exam conflicts with other classes; we strongly discourage enrollment in another class with conflicting lectures and/or final exam; if you choose to enroll in such a class you will have to make arrangements for an alternate final with the other class.

Exam Dates
Midterm Date: TBD
Final Date: 12/13/22 Tuesday 3-6 pm
Exam Attendance Policy
You must attend all exams to pass the class. We will consider granting an incomplete given extenuating circumstances that are communicated to course staff.


## Grading

We are grading according to department guidelines on grades. The score upon which the grade will be assigned will be computed as follows:

Discussion Attendance: 5%
Vitamin: 5% (lowest two vitamins before the midterm and lowest two after the midterm dropped)
Homework: 20% (lowest two homeworks before the midterm and lowest two after the midterm dropped)
Midterm: 25%
Final: 45%
There will also be a “no-homework” option with a score computed without homework as follows:

Discussion Attendance: 6.25%
Vitamins: 6.25% (lowest two vitamins before the midterm and lowest two after the midterm dropped)
Midterm: 31.25%
Final: 56.25%
Since there will only be one midterm, we have a partial clobber policy on the midterm or the final, your other score can be partially clobbered if you happen to do poorly. More details will be released in the coming weeks.


## Collaboration

You are welcome to work on homework problems in study groups of two to five people; however, you must always write up the solutions on your own. Similarly, you may use books or online resources to help solve homework problems, but you must always credit all such sources in your writeup and you must never copy material verbatim.

We believe that most students can distinguish between helping other students and violating the policies. You may discuss approaches but your solution must be written by you and you only. You should acknowledge everyone whom you have worked with or who has given you any significant ideas about the homework.

## Closing Thoughts

### Read the lecture notes before lecture

The material takes some time to sink in. You’ll be able to pick up the nuances if you’ve already got a gist of what will be covered.

### Keep up

In a conceptual class such as this, it is particularly important to maintain a steady effort throughout the semester, rather than hope to cram just before homework deadlines or exams. This is because it takes time and practice for the ideas to sink in. Make sure you allocate a sufficient number of hours every week to the class, including enough time for reading and understanding the material as well as for doing assignments. (As a rough guide, you should expect to do at least one hour of reading and two hours of problem solving for each hour of lecture.) Even though this class does not have any major projects, you should plan to spend as much time on it as on any of your other technical classes.

### Take homework seriously

The homeworks are explicitly designed to help you to learn the material as you go along. Although the numerical weight of the homeworks is not huge, we work hard to make them instructive and interesting. Do read the sample solutions, even for the problems on which you received full points. You may well learn a different way of looking at the problem, and you may also benefit from emulating the style of the solutions. (In science, people learn a lot from emulating the approach of more experienced scientists.) Even for those in the “no-homework” option, we highly encourage you to attempt the homeworks and review the solutions.

### Start homeworks early

Our best advice is to read through the homework problems as soon as they are available and let them percolate in your brain. Think through possible approaches while you are waiting in line, or stuck in an elevator. Sleeping on a problem, or taking a walk has often helped people to come up with a creative approach to it. Definitely do not wait until the night before it is due to start working on the homework.

### Make use of office hours

The professors and TAs hold office hours expressly to help you. It is often surprising how many students do not take advantage of this service. You are free to attend as many office hours as you wish (you are not constrained just to use the office hours of your section TA). You will also likely get more out of an office hour if you have spent a little time in advance thinking about the questions you have, and formulating them precisely. (In fact, this process can often lead you to a solution yourself!)

### Take part in discussion sections

Discussion sections are not auxiliary lectures. They are an opportunity for interactive learning, through guided group problem solving and other activities. The success of a discussion section depends largely on the willingness of students to participate actively in it. As with office hours, the better prepared you are for the discussion, the more you are likely to get out of it.

### Form study groups

As stated above, you are welcome to form small groups (two to four people) to work together on homeworks and on understanding the class material on a regular basis. In addition to being fun, this can save you a lot of time by generating ideas quickly and preventing you from getting hung up on some point or other. Of course, it is your responsibility to ensure that you contribute actively to the group; passive listening will likely not help you much. And recall the caveat above that you must write up your solutions on your own. Homework parties are an alternative vehicle for working with others in a nice atmosphere and can be a good place to find a group to work with regularly.

### Pay attention in lectures

As the semester proceeds, many of you will no doubt feel the urge to ‘daydream’ during lectures or to skip them altogether, on the grounds that you can catch up by reading the lecture notes. If you follow this strategy, you should be aware that reading mathematics is NOT the same as reading a novel or a news article: each page of mathematics needs to be read many times before it is fully understood, and needs to be backed up by examples and discussion. Following the material in class should save you several readings; even just watching it go by without fully understanding it makes your later reading easier. And you also get the benefit of student questions, examples, etc. Exactly how you handle lectures is up to you. One strategy is to print out the lecture notes in advance, bring them to lecture, and add a few additional notes during class.
