# Logic, Section 2

### Statements
A statement (or proposition) is a sentence that is either true or false (but not both). Statements are a way to show mathematical thought. We have to have a property though: true or false.

ie) 2 + 2 = 4, True, *Statement*

ie) 2 + 2 = 5, False this will always be false. No one would dispute this *Statement*.

ie) Fridays are nice, this is subjective. Someone can dispute this and say Friday's are not nice. *Not a statement*

ie) 2 + 2 = 3, *Statement*, even though it is false, it is a statement because it is always false and never true.

### Compound Statements
Remember, statements are either true or false, but neither both.

ex) My brother John, is a student. This is always true or always false depending on whether John is a student. *Statement*
ex) He is a student. This is sometimes true and sometimes false, because we do not know who he is. "He" can be retired. *Not a statement*
ex) 3 + 5 = 8 *Statement*

Logical Connectives: how you put or connect together multiple statements in 1 sentence. 

```
and | Ʌ | conjunction
or | V | disjunction
negation | ~ or ¬
```

ex)
Let p be the statement, my brother John is a student.
Let q be the statement, 3 + 5 = 8

We can write p Ʌ q, p V q, ~p Ʌ q, etc.

ex)
Let p be the statement, it is cold
Let p be the statement, it is cloudy

How do we represent the notation for the compound statement: It is not cold, but it is cloudy.
~p Ʌ q

Remember but is the same thing as and
