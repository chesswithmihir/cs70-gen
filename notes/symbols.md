Natural numbers (ℕ): The counting numbers {1, 2, 3, ...} are commonly called natural numbers; however, other definitions include 0, so that the non-negative integers {0, 1, 2, 3, ...} are also called natural numbers. Natural numbers including 0 are also called whole numbers.[1][2]

Integers (ℤ): Positive and negative counting numbers, as well as zero: {..., −3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...}.

Rational numbers (ℚ): Numbers that can be expressed as a ratio of an integer to a non-zero integer.[3] All integers are rational, but there are rational numbers that are not integers, such as −2/9.

Real numbers (ℝ): Numbers that correspond to points along a line. They can be positive, negative, or zero. All rational numbers are real, but the converse is not true.

Irrational numbers: Real numbers that are not rational.

Imaginary numbers (i): Numbers that equal the product of a real number and the square root of −1. The number 0 is both real and purely imaginary.

Complex numbers (C): Includes real numbers, imaginary numbers, and sums and differences of real and imaginary numbers.

Hypercomplex numbers include various number-system extensions: quaternions ({\displaystyle \mathbb {H} }\mathbb {H} ), octonions ({\displaystyle \mathbb {O} }\mathbb {O} ), and other less common variants.[4]

p-adic numbers: Various number systems constructed using limits of rational numbers, according to notions of "limit" different from the one used to construct the real numbers.
