> (¬P ⇒ R) ∧ (¬P ⇒ ¬R) ≡ P

This is a **True** statement because it is very similar to a contradiction like (¬P ⇒ ¬R ∧ R) ≡ P. This is also equal to (¬P ⇒ False) ≡ P. This must be a true statement because if P is False, then it is True ⇒ False ≡ False which is True or if P is True, then it is vacuously true. False ⇒ False ≡ True.

> If b ≡ c (mod p), then a<sup>b</sup> ≡ a<sup>c</sup> (mod p).

False. Try p = 7. a = 2, b = 1, c = 8

2<sup>1</sup> ≡ 2<sup>8</sup> (mod 7) <br>
2 ≡ 4 (mod 7) <br>
False.

> Give an expression using terms involving ∨,∧ and ¬ which is true if and only if exactly one of X,Y, and Z are true. (Just to remind you: (X ∧Y ∧Z) means all three of X,Y,Z are true, (X ∨Y ∨Z) means at least one of X,Y and Z is true.)

(X ∧ ¬Y ∧ ¬Z)∨(¬X ∧Y ∧ ¬Z)∨(¬X ∧ ¬Y ∧Z)
