# Logic

Write a logical formula that describes the proposition: the square of any natural number is a natural number:‚àÄn ‚àà N,‚àÉm ‚àà N,n<sup>2</sup> = m

# Stable Matching
Every job can get rejected during a run of the job-proposed algorithm

Every stable matching must have a candidate that was not proposed to until the very last day. (**Discussion 2A**)

The worst case of stable matching is always ùëõ2‚àí2ùëõ+2  less than n. The best case is always 1.

In any execution of the algorithm, there is at least one candidate who only receives a single proposal.

Max rejections: (n - 1)<sup>2</sup><br>
Max rogue pairs: n(n - 1)

# Graphs

For trees maybe induct on vertices instead of edges. For other graphs maybe induct on edges. (**discussion 2B**)

Every tree must always have two leaves. Leaves are always degree 1. (**fa21 midterm 1**)

hypercube is bipartite. (**fa21 midterm 1**) <br>
n-dimensional hypercube is edge colorable with n colors.
n-dimensional hypercube is vertex colorable with 2 colors.

A connected acyclic graph is known as a tree (**fa21 midterm 1**)

4-color theorem: <br>
If a graph is planar, it can be colored only using 4 colors. <br>
Contrapositive is also true: <br>
If a graph can't be colored in 4 colors (requires more than 4 colors), it must be nonplanar. (**Discussion 3A**)

If a graph is planar, then it must follow that e ‚â§ 3v - 6.

Recall that any bipartite planar graph G = (V,E) satisfies |E| ‚â§ 2|V |‚àí4.

What the frick is bijection?

| Term | no repeated vertices | no repeated edges | start = end |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| walk | | | |
| path | ‚úì | ‚úì | |
| tour | | | ‚úì |
| cycle | ‚úì | ‚úì | ‚úì |
| Eulerian Walk | | ‚úì | |
| Eulerian Tour | | ‚úì | ‚úì |


*Note that for a cycle, there are no repeated vertices except for the start and end vertices.*

*Note an Eulerian Walk typically had even degree for every vertex or has starting and ending vertices of odd degree. (0, 2 odd degree vertices)*

A hypercube of dimension 4 and above contains K<sub>3, 3</sub> which means that it is nonplanar. This means that a hypercube of dimension 3 or less is planar.

(Euler‚Äôs formula) For every connected planar graph, v + f = e + 2

In a planar drawing, each edge is adjacent to at most 2 faces. And for a graph where the minimum length cycle is 6, each face is adjacent to at least 6 edges. Thus we have that 6f ‚â§ 2e. <br>
Plugging in to Euler's formula, we see that v + 2/6e ‚â• e + 2 or that 2e ‚â§ 3v - 6. Thus the average degree is 2e/v ‚â§ 3 - 2/v

There is always a vertex of degree 3 at most in a connected bipartite planar graph. Recall that any bipartite planar graph G = (V,E) satisfies |E| ‚â§ 2|V| ‚àí 4. (You should give as tight of a bound as possible.)

To show this: 2|E| ‚â§ 4|V| ‚àí 8. Total degree at most 4|V| ‚àí 8. Divide by |V| to get 4 - 8 / |V|. So the total degree must have at most a little less than 4 or 3 degree.

# Modular Arithmetic

If you are trying to find inverse of a in mod m, it can only exist if gcd(a, m) <br>
gcd(a, a + b) = gcd(a, b) <br>
gcd(Fib(n), Fib(n - 1)) = 1

CRT can be coprime
